# Real-Estate-data-web-scraping
These are my raw and unpolished R codes to capture data from property websites.   
The reasons that I do this is because: 
1. I want to practise my skills of playing Rselenium and rvest packages 
2. Most real estate webs do not provide sufficient options to filter keywords such as "heating" and "air conditioning".  
3. Efficiently select the property pool that I want to rent/buy 
4. Collect data to analyse and model regression to evaluate the price.  I am still working on the 4th object.  

This project would also work as an entry-level tutorial for people who are interested in Rselenium and rvest.
